# Vidi
## What it does
Vidi is a program, that is able to convert color information of your Webcam to Midi signals and directly pass them to your Midi compatible Program or directly to Midi connected Hardware

## How to install
You have to install the following:

  - Python 3.x

  - tkinter

  - Open cv2

  - numpy

  - python rtmidi


## How to run
Execute the run.sh or vidi.py

Add object as color and set it up. Bright colors work best. Start the Midi screen and enjoy!

Sometimes opening Midiports doesnt work very well and played notes will stay on. In this case open "None" instead. It will open a virtual port you can connect to from your device or programm.
